## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

Additionally, there are two helper classes (i.e.`CommandHistory` and `HelpContentProvider`) that do not inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class. They exist to provide their corresponding UI elements with the necessary information to perform their function.
* `CommandHistory` stores past commands that the user has entered, regardless if it was a valid command or not, to be used to fill `CommandBox`
* `HelpContentProvider` gets the information needed to populate `HelpWindow`

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1 3 6-9")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object). Each `Person` holds exactly one `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address`, `Note`, and `VisitDateTime` object, along with zero or more `Tag` objects.
* manages the lifecycle of clients' data, including adding, deleting, and archiving/unarchiving persons.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects as a _separate filtered list_ which is exposed as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` to be viewed. The UI can be bound to this list so that UI can automatically update when the data in the list changes.
* supports dynamic filtering of the person list via predicates such as `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `TagContainsPredicate` (with partial matching), and `VisitContainsDatePredicate`.
* provides an interface for sorting the filtered list via `sortFilteredPersonList`, allowing users to reorder the UI view without changing the original data order.
* stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents the user's preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPrefs` object.
* exposes the address book data as a `ReadOnlyAddressBook` object to prevent unintended modification from outside the `Model`.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** `Note` and `VisitDateTime` are optional fields from the user's perspective. However, a `Person` object always contains one `Note` and one `VisitDateTime` object, empty values simply represent fields that have not been set by the user. Also, the `isArchived` flag is a boolean attribute used by the `Model` to determine a contact's visibility in the default contact list.

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

The following is a non-exhaustive list of common classes that live in `seedu.address.commons` and are reused across multiple components:
* Config — stores application configuration such as logging level and file paths.
* GuiSettings — stores UI-related preferences such as window size and position.
* LogsCenter — configures and manages application-wide logging, providing logger instances used across the system.
* JsonUtil and FileUtil — handle data persistence by providing utilities for reading, writing, and serializing data to and from JSON files.
* DataLoadingException and IllegalValueException — represent exceptions related to data loading and validation errors.
* Utility classes such as `AppUtil`, `CollectionUtil`, and `StringUtil` provide helper methods for common operations like argument validation, collection handling, and string processing.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Guideline:** Components should interact with these classes through their public APIs (interfaces or utility methods) rather than their internal implementation details to maintain loose coupling and improve testability.

**Disclaimer:** This is a non-exhaustive list of common classes intended to give developers an overview of shared utilities in the application. Refer to the `commons` package for the complete list of classes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Archive Feature

#### Implementation

The `archive` mechanism is facilitated by an archive flag stored in each contact.
A contact is considered archived when this flag is true, and active otherwise.

The mechanism uses the following Model operations:

- `archivePerson(person)`: marks a contact as archived.
- `unarchivePerson(person)`: marks a contact as active again.
- `updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)`: refreshes the displayed list for the current command context.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the archive mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `archive 1`.
The `archive` command validates the index against the current filtered list and archives the selected contact.

Step 2. The command refreshes the filtered list using the current predicate so the UI reflects the updated state.

Step 3. The user executes `list-archive`.
The displayed list is filtered to show only archived contacts.

Step 4. The user executes `unarchive 1` from the archived list.
The `unarchive` command marks the selected contact as active again and refreshes the list.

Step 5. The command result is returned to `Logic`, and `Logic` persists the updated address book through `Storage`.

The following sequence diagram shows how an `archive` operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/ArchiveSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the archive command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `ArchiveCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of the diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an `archive` operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/ArchiveSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" width="420" />

The `unarchive` command does the opposite. It calls `unarchivePerson(person)`, which restores the selected contact to active state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the selected index is invalid, the command returns an error instead of modifying data.
**Note:** `list-archive` filtering is applied through `updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)`, not inside `archivePerson(...)`.

</box>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `archive` command:

<puml src="diagrams/ArchiveActivityDiagram.puml" width="420" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the command returns an error (for example invalid index), no data is modified.
**Note:** After successful command execution, Logic persists the current address book through `Storage`.

</box>

#### Design considerations

Aspect: How archived data is represented

1. Alternative 1 (current choice): Keep an archive flag in each Person.
   - Pros: Minimal structural changes, straightforward persistence, low implementation overhead.
   - Cons: Filtering predicates must be applied consistently across commands.


2. Alternative 2: Move archived contacts into a separate collection.
   - Pros: Strong conceptual separation between active and archived contacts.
   - Cons: Higher complexity for edit, find, delete, indexing, and synchronization logic.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of client and service contacts
* frequently conducts home visits and requires quick access to visit details
* works under time pressure and must efficiently track last and upcoming visits
* needs to categorise contacts into different roles (e.g., Client, family members, government services)
* requires reminders for follow-ups and scheduled check-ins
* prefers a simple, distraction-free desktop application
* is comfortable using keyboard-driven interfaces and typing commands
* values speed and efficiency over complex graphical interfaces
* wants all visit-related information consolidated in one place

**Value proposition**: Currently, social workers rely on a combination of paper notebooks,
calendars and messaging apps to track who they are visiting, where it takes place and the
purpose or outcome of each visit. This fragmentation increases administrative workload,
raises the risk of missed follow-ups or incomplete records, and reduces overall efficiency.
CareSync helps social service workers keep track of their clients and service contact
details as well as allow them to easily track upcoming visits with the various families.

4. The system should support at least 20 contacts without noticeable performance degradation.
5. Filtering and search operations should complete within 2 seconds.
6. The system should be able to load stored data within 3 seconds upon startup.
7. The application should not crash upon receiving malformed data.
8. Error messages shall be clear and actionable (e.g., specify which field is invalid).
9. Command syntax shall be consistent and predictable across features.
10. The system shall automatically persist data after every valid modification.
11. Completed visits shall not be modified without explicit action.
12. Contact names shall not be empty.
13. Phone numbers shall follow a defined format.
14. Dates and times shall follow a consistent format.
15. Duplicate contacts shall not be allowed unless explicitly permitted.
14. The system architecture should allow future expansion of features (e.g., additional

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS.
* **Tag**: A label that can be assigned to a contact to categorise them.
* **ID**: The currently displayed list number of the specific contact.
* **Case ID**: A Case ID is a unique identifier assigned to a specific client
case or record within CareSync. It allows users to track and reference a particular
case efficiently, ensuring that all family members that are associated with the
clients are displayed.
* **Command**: An instruction entered by the user to execute a specific action.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</box>

### Manual testing conventions

- Detailed command syntax, parameter constraints, and usage examples are documented in the [User Guide](UserGuide.md) under each command section
- DG manual tests focus on behavior verification (state change, list update, and error handling), not re-explaining command format
- For commands using `INDEX`, run `list` first (or `list-archive` for `unarchive`) unless the test case explicitly requires a filtered list
- Where a negative test lists a message, verify the exact message shown in the result box

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancement**
Team Size: 5

6. **Allow contacts with identical names but different details:** Currently, the application does not allow multiple contacts with the same name even if their other details differ. We plan to allow contacts to share the same name as long as other identifying fields (e.g. phone number, address) are different, so that users can manage contacts with common names more effectively.
7. **Improve response command box usability:** Currently, the response text box requires horizontal scrolling to view long messages and is too small, making it difficult for users to read outputs without excessive scrolling. We plan to modify the UI so that the text box wraps text and supports vertical scrolling, as well as increase its size to display more content at once for better readability.
8. **Enable sorting in archived contact list:** Currently, users are unable to sort contacts in the archived list. We plan to add sorting functionality (e.g. by name and visit date) to the archived contacts list to improve usability and navigation. For example, users can enter `list-archive s/name` to view archived contacts sorted by name or `list-archive s/visit` to view archived contacts sorted by visit date.
9. **Allow text selection in help window:** Currently, users are unable to select or copy text from the help window. We plan to enable text selection so that users can copy commands or instructions easily for reference.
10. **Support bulk archive and unarchive of contacts:** Currently, users can only archive or unarchive contacts individually. We plan to allow users to perform bulk archive and unarchive actions on multiple contacts in a single command to improve efficiency. For example, users can enter `archive 1 3-5 8` to archive multiple contacts at once or `unarchive 1 4 6` to unarchive multiple contacts at once.

## **Appendix: Effort**

This appendix summarises the overall effort put in by the team for CareSync. Using AB3 as a reference point, it also details the difficulty level, challenges faced, achievements and reuse of the project.

##### Difficulty Level

AB3 manages a single entity with basic features such as:
- Adding a person
- Editing a person
- Deleting a person
- Finding a person by name
- Listing all persons

CareSync builds upon these existing features and introduces even more complex features aimed to provide real value to our target users:
- Adding notes to contacts
- Storing clients' visit date and time
- Finding contacts by tag or visit date
- Sorting the contact list by name or visit date-time
- Bulk delete operation
- Archiving contacts
- Autocomplete commands
- Cycle through past commands for reuse

Additionally, CareSync introduces constraints of higher complexity in order to reduce bugs and ensure consistency:
- `NAME`, `PHONE_NUMBER`, `EMAIL`, `ADDRESS`, `NOTE` - character validity and length constraints
- `TAG` - case-insensitive (for duplicate removal) and length constraints
- `find` command - mutual exclusivity for search modes and usage of special keywords (i.e. `today`)
- `delete` command - range index validation
- Autocomplete - command validity check before suggestions
- Command History - Collapsing consecutive identical commands

Compared to AB3's single entity workflow, CareSync required more cross-feature validation, parser disambiguation and logic-model-storage-UI synchronisation due to richer contact lifecycle management. The combination of improving features and constraints demanded intricate designing and testing to ensure CareSync's correctness. Moreover, CareSync was built with code quality and design principles in mind, which required further refactoring and architectural deliberation. Some challenges faced include:
- **Parser and command interaction complexity:** Features such as find modes, today keyword handling, bulk range deletion, autocomplete and command history introduced many edge cases where it might not work as intended. Thus, we had to carefully define precedence and rejection conditions to avoid ambiguous behaviour. One concrete example would be range deletion whereby the original implementation was vulnerable to an integer overflow when the user supplied `MAX_INT`. Therefore, we had to intentionally change the counting variable to `long` in order to patch this bug/vulnerability. This also shows our rigorous testing process when we introduce new features.
- **Validation consistency across fields:** Enforcing strict constraints for multiple fields and ensuring consistent error handling/messages required substantial effort, especially for boundary cases and invalid combinations of inputs. For instance, the autocomplete feature presented many edge case bugs that we had to remedy, such as `add x n` suggesting `/` or `add n/ x/ ` suggesting `p/` even though both commands entered were already invalid.
- **Data and model evolution risks:** Adding new data fields and archive-related behaviour required careful updates across logic, model, storage and UI layers so existing data remains valid and behaviour stays backward compatible.

#### Achievements

- **Disciplined Git Workflow:** Followed a strict branch-based forking workflow, ensuring that the `master` branch remained stable at all times, with effective collaboration via pull requests and code reviews.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Ensured that code coverage did not drop below initial AB3 levels and documented equivalent partitions / boundary values for test cases in order to aid with future development.
- **Code Quality Adherence:** Achieved a high degree of maintainability and quality by strictly following coding standards, design principles and *SLAPPING hard*.
- **Rigorous Input Validation:** Implemented many validating methods to guarantee correctness especially for boundary values.

#### Reuse
CareSync being built on top of AB3, reuses a significant portion of AB3's architecture and codebase. These include the already existing MVC pattern architecture, command pattern architecture, Jackson-based JSON storage, JavaFX UI, JUnit test cases, Gradle configuration and documentation site structure. AB3's existing features such as `add` and `delete` were adapted to create CareSync's version, and JavaFX UI elements were added onto to allow for notes and visit date-times.
