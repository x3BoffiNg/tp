## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1 3 6-9")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Archive Feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The archive mechanism is facilitated by an archive flag stored in each Person.
A person is considered archived when this flag is true, and active otherwise.

The mechanism uses the following Model operations:

- archivePerson(person): marks a person as archived.
- unarchivePerson(person): marks a person as active again.
- updateFilteredPersonList(predicate): refreshes the displayed list for the current command context.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the archive mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes archive 1.
The archive command validates the index against the current filtered list and archives the selected person.

Step 2. The command refreshes the filtered list using the current predicate so the UI reflects the updated state.

Step 3. The user executes list-archive.
The displayed list is filtered to show only archived persons.

Step 4. The user executes unarchive 1 from the archived list.
The unarchive command marks the selected person as active again and refreshes the list.

Step 5. The command result is returned to Logic, and Logic persists the updated address book through Storage.

The following sequence diagram shows how an archive operation goes through the Logic component:

<puml src="diagrams/ArchiveSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the archive command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for ArchiveCommandParser should end at the destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of the diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an archive operation goes through the Model component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/ArchiveSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" width="420" />

The unarchive command does the opposite. It calls unarchivePerson(person), which restores the selected person to active state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the selected index is invalid, the command returns an error instead of modifying data.
**Note:** list-archive filtering is applied through updateFilteredPersonList(predicate), not inside archivePerson(...).

</box>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the archive command:

<puml src="diagrams/ArchiveActivityDiagram.puml" width="420" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the command returns an error (for example invalid index), no data is modified.
**Note:** After successful command execution, Logic persists the current address book through Storage.

</box>

#### Design considerations

Aspect: How archived data is represented

1. Alternative 1 (current choice): Keep an archive flag in each Person.
   - Pros: Minimal structural changes, straightforward persistence, low implementation overhead.
   - Cons: Filtering predicates must be applied consistently across commands.

2. Alternative 2: Move archived persons into a separate collection.
   - Pros: Strong conceptual separation between active and archived contacts.
   - Cons: Higher complexity for edit, find, delete, indexing, and synchronization logic.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of client and service contacts
* frequently conducts home visits and requires quick access to visit details
* works under time pressure and must efficiently track last and upcoming visits
* needs to categorise contacts into different roles (e.g., Client, family members, government services)
* requires reminders for follow-ups and scheduled check-ins
* prefers a simple, distraction-free desktop application
* is comfortable using keyboard-driven interfaces and typing commands
* values speed and efficiency over complex graphical interfaces
* wants all visit-related information consolidated in one place

**Value proposition**: Currently, social workers rely on a combination of paper notebooks,
calendars and messaging apps to track who they are visiting, where it takes place and the
purpose or outcome of each visit. This fragmentation increases administrative workload,
raises the risk of missed follow-ups or incomplete records, and reduces overall efficiency.
CareSync helps social service workers keep track of their clients and service contact
details as well as allow them to easily track upcoming visits with the various families.
